# Interactive Virtual Music Board

## Use Case / Goal of the Project:
The Interactive Virtual Music Board is designed to provide an engaging platform for users to experiment with music creation. Users can interact with different instrument buttons, upload custom sound files, and play them in a loop. This tool is ideal for educational purposes, entertainment, and fostering creativity, allowing users to simulate a digital jam session.

## Things Done So Far (Version 2.04):
- Implemented buttons for various instrument categories: Drums, Strings, Piano, and Vocals.
- Added functionality to allow users to upload audio files (.mp3 or .wav) and assign them to buttons.
- Enabled buttons to toggle sound playback in a loop, with a visual indicator for active buttons.
- Introduced key combinations (e.g., '1+D') to simulate button presses via the keyboard.
- Tracked pressed keys and simulated corresponding button clicks for matching combinations.

## Thinking Going to Happen in Future:
- Introduce a menu section to categorize and select different music genres for a more personalized experience.
- Provide a library of stock audio files for users who do not have custom sounds to upload.
- Enhance the user interface with a more professional design, incorporating animations and better visuals.
- Synchronize all sounds with a unified tempo and beats-per-minute (BPM) setting to ensure seamless playback without overlapping issues.
- Expand the functionality to support collaborative features or multi-user interaction for group music sessions.
